Usage Instructions
------------------

Currently there are three development tools and frameworks, **Arduino IDE**, **ESP-IDF** and **PlatformIO**, providing flexible development options, you can choose the right development tool according to your project needs and personal habits.

Development Tool
----------------



  * Arduino IDEArduino IDE is an open source electronic prototyping platform, convenient and flexible, easy to get started. After a simple learning, you can start to develop quickly. At the same time, Arduino has a large global user community, providing an abundance of open source code, project examples and tutorials, as well as rich library resources, encapsulating complex functions, allowing developers to quickly implement various functions.
  * ESP-IDFESP-IDF, or full name Espressif IDE, is a professional development framework introduced by Espressif Technology for the ESP series chips. It is developed using the C language, including a compiler, debugger, and flashing tool, etc., and can be developed via the command lines or through an integrated development environment (such as Visual Studio Code with the Espressif IDF plugin). The plugin offers features such as code navigation, project management, and debugging, etc.
  * PlatformIOPlatformIO is a cross-platform, cross-architecture, multi-framework professional tool for embedded system engineers and software developers who write applications for embedded products.


Each of these three development approaches has its own advantages, and developers can choose according to their needs and skill levels. Arduino and PlatformIO (faster compilation speed) are suitable for beginners and non-professionals because they are easy to learn and quick to get started. ESP-IDF is a better choice for developers with a professional background or high performance requirements, as it provides more advanced development tools and greater control capabilities for the development of complex projects.

Precautions
-----------

*   The development board has an onboard automatic download circuit, the Type C port at the UART silk screen is used for program download and log printing. After downloading the program, press the RESET button to run the program
*   Please pay attention to the PCB antenna area when using, and avoid attaching other metals or plastic parts to the PCB antenna
*   The TF card uses SPI/MMC to communicate, note that the SD\_CS pin needs to be driven by the EXIO4 of the IO EXTENSION
*   The development board uses PH2.0 header to lead out ADC, CAN, I2C, RS485, 5V peripheral pins, and connects sensor components using PH2.0 to 2.54mm male connector
*   The CAN and RS485 peripherals use use a dip switch to connect the 120 ohm resistor by default, and NC can optionally cancel the termination resistor connection
*   The 7inch screen occupies the vast majority of the GPIO, and the development board uses the chip to expand the IO for reset, backlight on/off, brightness adjustment, and battery voltage reading, etc.
*   **The development board uses USB to download the demo. If the port cannot be recognized, please enter boot mode (press and hold the boot button, then connect to the computer, and then release the boot button). After downloading the demo, press the RESET button to run the demo.**
*   Currently, under ESP-IDF v5.3, the average frame rate limit for running the LVGL benchmark demo with a single core is 17 frames per second, corresponding to an interface PCLK rate of 30 MHz). Before compilation, ESP32 and LVGL need to be configured through menuconfig:

```
CONFIG_FREERTOS_HZ=1000
CONFIG_ESP_DEFAULT_CPU_FREQ_MHZ_240=y
CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHMODE_QIO=y

#### ESP-IDF Project Details

*   Component: The components in ESP-IDF are the basic modules for building applications, each component is usually a relatively independent code base or library, which can implement specific functions or services, and can be reused by applications or other components, similar to the definition of libraries in Python development.
    *   Component reference: The import of libraries in the Python development environment only requires to "import library name or path", while ESP-IDF is based on the C language, and the importing of libraries is configured and defined through `CMakeLists.txt`.
    *   The purpose of CmakeLists.txt: When compiling ESP-IDF, the build tool `CMake` first reads the content of the top-level `CMakeLists.txt` in the project directory to read the build rules and identify the content to be compiled. When the required components and demos are imported into the `CMakeLists.txt`, the compilation tool `CMake` will import each content that needs to be compiled according to the index. The compilation process is as follows:
